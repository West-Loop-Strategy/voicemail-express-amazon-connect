# Voicemail Express V3
Voicemail Express is designed to provide basic voicemail functionality to Amazon Connect. It has been designed to work seamlessly behind the scenes, providing voicemail options for all agents and queues by default. It is an evolution of the Voicemail Express solution that was created specifically for Service Cloud Voice customers by the AWS team that worked with Salesforce to develop Service Cloud Voice. That solution has been cloned and included with Service Cloud Voice, and is now used at scale by customers on that offering. This version removes the Salesforce-centric options, providing the same easy-to-deploy-and-use voicemail option for standard Amazon Connect customers. Typically speaking, Voicemail Express can be deployed and validated in less than 15 minutes.

## What's new in WLSConnectVoicemail3 (2024.09.01)
-  **Guided Task Delivery Mode**: Improves agent experience for tasks by providing a visual player and transcript in an agent guide view. Obfuscates the presigned url, which is also has a reduced lifespan of minutes instead of days. 
-  **Security Enhancements**: Moved from one unified role to one role per function, with strict policies to limit blast radius of compromised roles. For Guided Task delivery, removes the IAM user requirement for presigned URLs. 
-  **Improved Recording Lifecycle**: Seperated the presigned URL lifecycle from the s3 object lifecycle. Allows for longer retention of recordings while still being able to have a more reasonable lifecycle policy. For example, creating a presigned URL good for only 1 day, but a lifecycle policy that moves recordings to Glacier after 180 days.
-  **Additional Fixes and Enhancements**: Added an option to indicate which user field holds the agent email for email delivery mode. Fixed an issue with custom template use. 

## How it works
With Voicemail Express, customers can have the option to leave a voicemail for an individual agent or an Amazon Connect Queue. Once the voicemail is recorded, a series of processes take place in the following order:
1. Voicemail recording is extracted and stored in S3 as a .wav file
1. The recording is transcribed using Amazon Transcribe
1. A presigned URL is generated that provides access to the voicemail recording without the need for further authentication
1. The voicemail is packaged for delivery, including the transcription, presigned URL, and contact data. It is then delivered as an Amazon Connect Task, Guided Task, or via email using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), depending on your configuration.

Voicemail presigned URLs are configured for a maximum length of 7 days. After 7 days, the presigned URL is no longer valid. A seperate timeframe is configured for the recordings, which are lifecycled as desired once that timeframe is met. During deployment, you have the option to configure the lifecycle window, if desired. Additionally, you have the option to keep, archive, or delete voicemail recordings.
